# Data Processing for Machine Learning With Python

The course was intended to let the people get acquianted with the basics of data processing and understanding the hidden clues and corelate the numerical and visual data.

It was run by [EMK center]("https://emkcenter.org/"), as part of their broader bootcamp which has the aim to cover the basics and fundamentals of Machine Learning.

Assignments were provided in order to evaulate the learners' understanding and let them witness the practial implementation of Data Processing.

## [ODI bowler statistics analysis](ODI_bowler_analysis)
<br>

The dataset can be found [here]("https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283193.html"), and the following exercises had been performed in order to get familiar with data processing.
<br><br>

<i>
- Displaying the first 10 rows of the dataframe<br>
- Creating a markdown cell and explain the meaning of each column<br>
- finding the number of rows and columns in the dataframe<br>
- finding the data statistics and check for the data types<br>
- missing values present in the dataset<br>
- Renaming the column names appropriately<br>
- Number of players played for ICC<br>
- Number of different countries are present in this dataset <br>

## [EDA on Audi used cars](ODI_bowler_analysis)

<br>

The dataset can be found [here under Audi section.]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aishwaryamuthukumar/cars-dataset-audi-bmw-ford-hyundai-skoda-vw"), and the following exercises had been performed in order to get familiar with data processing and visualisation techniques.
<br><br>

<i>
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using groupby/pivot_table and barplot (total 9 barplots), based on model, transmission, and fuelType<br>
- Top 5 selling car models/transmission/fuelType in the dataset?<br>
- Average selling price of the top 5 selling car models/transmission/fuelType?<br>
- Total sale of the top 5 selling car models/transmission/fuelType<br>
